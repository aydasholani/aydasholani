# Ayda Sholani Portfolio
Welcome to Ayda's portfolio! 
I'm a passionate frontend developer and AI enthusiast based in Stockholm, Sweden with a background in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, Python, and SQLite.

I've built this portfolio using the framework Reactjs, gh-pages scss and bootstrap.

You can find my live page at [Ayda Sholani | Portfolio](https://aydasholani.github.io/portfolio/ "Link to my portfolio on GitHub pages").

I've also used [Weather Api](https://openweathermap.org/api "Link to API documentation") to fetch the current weather.
